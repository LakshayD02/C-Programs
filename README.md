# C-Programs

**Description:**

This repository provides practical C code examples covering a wide range of topics. Each program is designed to be clear, concise, and well-commented, making it easy to understand the underlying concepts. The repository is structured to allow easy navigation and exploration of different C programming areas. 🗺️

**Features:**

* **Basic Syntax and Data Types:** ➕ Programs demonstrating variable declarations, data type usage (int, float, char, etc.), operators, and basic input/output operations (printf, scanf). Examples include simple calculations, type conversions, and formatted output. 🔢
* **Control Flow:** 🚦 Examples illustrating conditional statements (if, else if, else, switch) and looping structures (for, while, do-while). Programs demonstrate decision-making, repetition, and controlling the program's execution flow. Includes examples like finding the largest number, generating patterns, and implementing menus. 🔀
* **Functions:** ⚙️ Programs demonstrating function definitions, calls, parameter passing (by value and by reference), and return values. Examples include modularizing code, creating reusable functions, and understanding function scope. Includes examples like implementing mathematical functions, and user-defined functions for specific tasks. 🧩
* **Arrays:** 📦 Programs working with one-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays. Examples include array initialization, accessing elements, searching, sorting, and performing operations on arrays. Covers concepts like array bounds, passing arrays to functions, and string manipulation using character arrays. 🔢
* **Pointers:** 📌 Examples illustrating pointer declarations, initialization, dereferencing, and pointer arithmetic. Demonstrates how to use pointers to manipulate data, pass arguments to functions efficiently, and work with dynamic memory allocation. Covers topics like pointers to arrays, pointers to functions, and dynamic memory allocation using `malloc` and `free`. ➡️
* **Strings:** 📜 Programs demonstrating string manipulation using character arrays and string functions from the string.h library. Examples include string concatenation, comparison, searching, and copying. 📝
* **Structures and Unions:** 🧱 Programs demonstrating the use of structures to group related data elements and unions to store different data types in the same memory location. Covers defining structures, accessing members, and using structures in conjunction with functions and pointers. 🗄️
* **File I/O:** 💾 Examples illustrating file operations such as opening, reading from, writing to, and closing files. Covers different file modes and how to handle file errors. 📂
* **Data Structures:** 🔗 Implementations of basic data structures like linked lists (singly and doubly linked), stacks, and queues. Provides examples of how to create, insert, delete, and traverse elements in these data structures. 📚
* **Algorithms:** 🤖 Implementations of common algorithms such as searching (linear search, binary search) and sorting (bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort). Provides examples of how to analyze algorithm efficiency and choose appropriate algorithms for specific tasks. 🔍
* **Mathematical Programs:** ➗ Examples of programs implementing mathematical calculations, such as factorial, Fibonacci series, prime number checking, and other mathematical functions. ➕

**Ideal For:**

* Beginners learning C programming. 👶
* Students taking introductory programming courses. 🧑‍🎓
* Developers looking for quick examples and references. 👨‍💻
* Anyone wanting to refresh their C programming skills. 🔄
